Welcome! This blog aims to document various projects and general tinkering with electronics projects and hobbyist CAD/CAM technologies.

These will be mostly based around:
- 3D Printing: I have an Ender 3
- CNC Machining: I have a CNC3018 PRO on the way
- Laser Engraving: I currently have a 500mw laser on my Ender 3
